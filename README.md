"# css-integration" 

First assignment, interface 1:
Used flexbox to align the 4 elements. Elements stack each other when on mobile.
Images are aligned right using float.

Second assignment, interface 2: block chart created using css divs.

Both interfaces were made using only html and css (no frameworks or sass)
because I wanted to test my "pure" css skills :)
